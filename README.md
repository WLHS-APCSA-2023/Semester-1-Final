# Semester-1-Final

## Primitive Types and If Statements:
Write a Java program that takes an integer input from the user and checks if it's a prime number. If the number is prime, print "It's a prime number." Otherwise, print "It's not a prime number."

## Boolean Logic and Loops:
Create a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100. Ask the user to guess the number. Provide feedback such as "Too high," "Too low," or "Correct!" until the user guesses the correct number. Use a boolean variable to track whether the game is over.

## Using Objects and Arrays:
Using the class Student I have included, I want you to create a new student with and ID number and give them 3 test scores. Then complete the testAverage method in Student.java and find the average of the three tests. 

To extend this, make the average method work for any number of exams. Pay attention to what the exams are intialized to and ignore these values when finding the average. You should say how many exams this is the average of e.g. "The average of the 2 exams is 94". You could also complete the toString method, the removeExam method, the numValidExam method

A sample output could look like: Student Bob with ID number 29 has an average score of 93.5 for 2 exams.

## Arrays and Loops:
Write a Java program that initializes an array of integers with values, and then calculates and prints the sum of all the values in the array that are divisible by 3.

## Primitive Types and If Statements:
Create a program that prompts the user to enter their age. Based on their age, provide different messages. If they are under 18, print "You are a minor." If they are between 18 and 65, print "You are an adult." If they are 65 or older, print "You are a senior citizen."
